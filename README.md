## About The Project
A lightweight C++ program that initialize projects from saved templates.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Download latest release from `https://github.com/Scrappyz/Template/releases`
2. Extract the `Project-Template` folder to your designated location
3. Copy the path to the `Project-Template` folder
4. Go to environmental variables
5. Add the copied path to the `Path`

You should now be able to use the `template` command in the command line

## Usage
The `template` command can be used as follows:
```
template <template-name>
```
When this command is executed, the files from `<template-name>` will be copied to the current directory.

### Saving Templates
Templates can be saved by adding them to the `Templates` folder inside `Project-Template`. Once this folder has been added, you can now initialize that template to the current directory with the `template` command.
